A bookmarklet for autoskipping (skippable) ads on youtube

## Description
There are a number of solutions for skipping ads on YouTube.
You have browser extensions or DNS-level ad-blockers such as Pie-hole.

For people who don't want to go through all of that, you can save the bkmklet file here as a bookmark and just click it when you load youtube.
The program will then automatically click on all skip ad/ skip ads buttons on the page whenever any are there. 
At the time of writing, it can even skip ads while the countdown is still active. 
If you reload the page, or if youtube reloads the whole page, then you will have to click the bookmark again to skip ads. 

## Further Development
Use something like Grunt to generate the bookmarklet from source code.
Set the volume to low while an unskippable ad is playing.
Minify the code such that it can be realistically run on a mobile phone with the use of one or two keyboard shortcuts.

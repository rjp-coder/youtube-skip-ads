A bookmarklet for autoskipping ads on youtube

## Description
There are a number of solutions for skipping ads on YouTube.
You have browser extensions or DNS-level ad-blockers such as Pie-hole.

For people who don't want to go through all of that, you can save the bkmklet file here as a bookmark and just click it when you load youtube.
Once run, you will see a green banner across the top of the page indicating that the code has been activated. 
The program will then automatically click on all skip ad/ skip ads buttons on the page whenever any are there. 
At the time of writing, it can even skip ads while the countdown is still active. 
If you reload the page, or if youtube reloads the whole page, then you will have to click the bookmark again to skip ads.
